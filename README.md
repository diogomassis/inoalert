## Overview

This application acts as a personal financial assistant. It continuously polls a stock API (Brapi.dev) for a specific asset. If the price crosses a user-defined threshold (Drop below Buy Price or Rise above Sell Price), it dispatches an email notification via SMTP.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Docker (optional)
- An SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, or [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io) for testing)

### Configuration

> ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING:** The `appsettings.json` file in this repository may contain example credentials for testing purposes. **NEVER** commit real production credentials (like your Gmail password or API Keys) to version control. For production environments, use **Environment Variables** or **.NET User Secrets** to securely override these settings without exposing them in the code.

Update `src/StockQuoteAlert/appsettings.json` with your SMTP credentials:

```json
"Smtp": {
  "Host": "smtp.mailtrap.io",
  "Port": 587,
  "User": "your_user",
  "Password": "your_password"
}
```
